The process generally takes up around 35 MB (RSS), it talks to a PostgreSQL database server on the same box. You would not want to run a service the size of Github on this but for a personal repository it is more than enough.

They have name recognition and prominence such that it wouldn&#x27;t really be a surprise to hear that they were doing so. I don&#x27;t have any internal details, so maybe the numbers just didn&#x27;t line up, but that would&#x27;ve been the investor-approved exit that allowed it to maintain some neutrality.</p><p>That leads to the next question: if GitHub didn&#x27;t&#x2F;couldn&#x27;t IPO with all of its name recognition, why should anyone expect that GitLab will?</p><p>While Atlassian&#x27;s open-source pedigree is much weaker, they own BitBucket, and they&#x27;re a bootstrapped startup that focuses on developer tools. They IPO&#x27;d a few years ago. They&#x27;re probably the best bet for developers interested in a &quot;neutral&quot; hosting platform.</p>",

Then we needed a better wiki for internal documentation, so we naturally went with Confluence.</p><p>So getting free Bitbucket heavily influenced our decision to buy two other products from the same company, and we are about to buy into their CI system (Bitbucket Pipelines, not the other one).

Out of that group, maybe one in a hundred can do it nearly as securely as one of the big services. This is the reason why people use the big centralised services, and also the reason smaller ones don&#x27;t survive: email is ridiculously over-complicated. You won&#x27;t convince anyone it isn&#x27;t by explaining that you managed to DIY in under a week.</p><p>Fortunately, rolling your own git isn&#x27;t nearly as hard, and the percentage of people who could run a node compared to total users is larger. Hell, every person using git also has a fully-functional, secure and standard self-hosting stack already installed. Getting a GitHub-like web interface is similarly easy. This fundamentally reduces the risk of centralising, which conversely means that people don&#x27;t have any qualms about using GitHub, since they can leave at any time. (Less true of issues, PRs, community, but hey.)</p><p>In either case, centralising has large benefits: one for handling complexity, one for giving you a community.</p><p>When you want decentralisation, it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t want a single entity controlling what the ecosystem becomes. The circumstances where this is true are typically big utility-like things, where we care more about guaranteeing that water and electricity exist than the top end of providers&#x27; profits. Email is like this. You would never build your own power station, just like these days it would be bordering on negligent to use anything except Office365&#x2F;GSuite&#x2F;etc as your corporate email host. Lots of jurisdictions will create highly regulated marketplaces so you don&#x27;t get Enron-California-style anti-competition. When things get that bad in Gmail-land, let us know.</p><p>[Edit: I was pretty snarky just there, but not at you! It was in general, I swear.]</p>",

I mean, no doubt such cases do exist, sure, but if you really look into how companies do become dominant, that is only one of many factors, and sometimes not even a necessary one.</p><p>&gt; I get the need for diversity, but as an individual, I am going to choose the best provider, even if they are the biggest one.</p><p>Well, but how do you evaluate what &quot;the best provider&quot; is?</p><p>You might be comparing functionality, say. Or price. Or speed. Or any other property of the product as you could now choose to use it. And obviously all of those are important things to consider.</p><p>But my suggestion isn&#x27;t that you should follow some abstract moral teaching because some ideology says that this is the right way, and the only right way. My point is that it may even be in our very own interest to choose a solution that is inferior in terms of current functionality&#x2F;price&#x2F;speed&#x2F;whatever because there are long-term costs attached to the superior solution that actually make it more expensive, all things considered, than using the inferior solution now. So, arguably, the currently technically inferior option with a lower total cost would actually the better solution.</p><p>To maybe make it more practical, but without any claim to being realistic, the numbers are obviously just made up: Let&#x27;s assume that using Gmail saves you 10 minutes every day  vs. using Thunderbird. Now, Gmail is privately owned, so if everyone chose to use Gmail, they would effectively have the monopoly over email. At that point, they have every incentive to add proprietary functionality for the sole purpose of making interoperability difficult. Which could prevent a new competitor from entering the market what would invent a new email workflow that would save you a further 10 minutes every day. Now, does choosing Gmail actually save you time overall? And is Gmail the better product if using Thunderbird now would lead to you being able to save 20 minutes a days a few years down the road?</p><p>This isn&#x27;t about some sort of diversity for diversity&#x27;s sake, this is about which of those options actually is in our very own long-term interest, and monopolies have a strong tendency to be very much not in the interest of the customer.</p><p>So, really, if anything, I would suggest that there is a moral obligation to watch out for people&#x2F;organizations accumulating too much power and to prevent them from obtaining it if the long-term damage that that concentration of power can do is worse than the short-term benefits obtained from using their offerings.</p>",

But noone ever argued aganst that.</p><p>When people talk about &quot;centralization&quot; in this context, they speak about power structures. A centralized power structure is when power is concentrated in the hands of a few. The fact that there are other forms of &quot;centralization&quot; is completely besides the point. If anything, the point is that you can often have those other forms of (useful) centralization without the centralization of power. Newsgroups, for example, obviously centralize discussion, in that they bring people who share an interest together in one (virtual) place. But they don&#x27;t centralize power, because the technical implementation makes it so that no one party can easily control the communication on all of usenet.</p><p>Noone argues that we shouldn&#x27;t have systems that allow us to interface with the world in a central location. This is all about avoiding concentration of power.</p><p>Your original argument is like saying that we should put all websites on the platform of a new company, say WebHub, because you want to have one place to search for websites. It&#x27;s ultimately a non-sequitur: Millions of companies independently host websites on this planet, but obviously you don&#x27;t visit millions of websites and ask the search function on each one of them your question of the day. You simply use one of a number of search engines, whichever one you prefer for your own needs, and no matter which search engine you choose to use, you will be searching pretty much the exact same set of websites. There is simply no need to centralize the power to control what can be published on the web or how the web works with one hosting company in order to have one central location that you can use to navtigate it all.</p><p>You don&#x27;t need centralization of power in order to have centralization of access.</p>",

It&#x27;s not high and complex maintenance, but it&#x27;s far from a fire and forget thing.</p><p>3) Contribution from external sources becomes harder, you generally don&#x27;t have basic &quot;fork&quot; and PR buttons in the simpler hosting git options, and if you opt for something like gitlab or gogs, external contributors as to register in your instance.</p><p>4) Github is really convenient if you are searching for open source tools that does a specific task in a specific language. Having various self hosted git servers makes it harder to discover new tools.</p><p>I do run my own Gogs instance which mirrors my github repositories, it&#x27;s not heavy maintenance, but it&#x27;s not exactly nothing.

      text: "<p>This is pretty conflicting. Github is nice on its own, but business wise they haven’t been profitable, so sooner or later some change had to happen. In my experience, Github is great for public code storage and small private projects (easy to manage developers that already have github accounts), but it does become pretty expensive and I don’t necessarily think the ROI is worth it compared to a self-hosted solution. For opensource and personal portfolios, the “network effect” or first mover advantage sort of set the stage for github’s popularity over gitlab, but for a paid enterprise solution I think gitlab does a better job and offers more value per dollar. Partially what sucks is having to have separate github&#x2F;gitlab accounts&#x2F;repositories since that’s now 2 things to manage. I’ve tried codecommit and bitbucket as well, but those were kinda meh (in my opinion).</p><p>Typically when “the Microsoft touch” is added it’s for the worse, so the expectations bar is pretty low. But who knows. I can definitely see them leveraging github to further go after AWS by giving Azure a leg up over codecommit. VSCode has also been pretty good, if they add in the “social integrations” of github to VSCode that also competes against Cloud9 on AWS. Right now AWS is solidly winning the cloud race, but if this puts price&#x2F;service competitive pressure on amazon I won’t complain.</p><p>I also wonder what will happen with all the code and personal data from github. I really don’t want to have to make a microsoft account to access github. As long as the switching costs from github to a viable alternative (right now gitlab) remain low, I would not have a problem with jumping ship.</p>",

When investors ask about our exit strategy, I have to be honest and say that acquisitions the big platform players in the space are largely ruled out; if we are to remain a neutral networking medium within our market, we can&#x27;t be biased -- or even the <i>suspicion</i> of bias -- towards any particular company within that market.</p><p>To illustrate this, the example I&#x27;ve always use is: &quot;Could GitHub still be GitHub if it was acquired by Microsoft? Of course not: a meaningful subset of its userbase could then no longer trust the platform to be a neutral intermediary, and the resulting exodus -- even if small -- would have a corrosive knock-on effect with regards to overall networking effect lock-in. So such an acquisition could never happen, because it would too obviously destroy value.&quot;</p><p>Didn&#x27;t expect to have the opportunity to validate that particular hypothesis!</p>",

The writing was on the wall here. They&#x27;ve focused on user growth and solidifiying their infrastructure, without much concern for profit - of course they&#x27;re looking for an exit.</p><p>I wonder if they chose to not go public due to the overlap with the Atlassian market. There wouldn&#x27;t be much to distinguish themselves in an IPO. They are - in the minds of many developers - better and cooler than Atlassian, but with less revenue. Perhaps GitHub figured a buyout had the better expected value, rather than risk being viewed as a me-too by investors.</p><p>I never really understood why GitHub succeeded over a decentralized model. It&#x27;s a social network for a service that does not need to be a social network. The small git hosting services that existed before GitHub got huge were just fine. It&#x27;s like what Reddit did to smaller forums - Reddit was not better, but it won the popularity lottery when Digg destroyed itself. I think the internet would be better without these massive centralized services. I hope the users who do decide to flee GitHub don&#x27;t aggregate elsewhere and end up in the same situation a few years from now.</p>',

It&#x27;s what they&#x27;re paying for; and it&#x27;s an extremely smart move (EXTREMELY). Some of GitHubs product offerings have competitors within the Microsoft ecosystem already, which may spell bad times for those long-term. Atom directly competes with VSCode and it simply doesn&#x27;t make sense to continue development of two, independent, IDEs. Electron utilizes Chromium under the hood, and I&#x27;d be hard pressed to thunk Microsoft wouldn&#x27;t want to try and inject Edge&#x2F;Chakra into that platform somehow.</p><p>It makes good business sense to consolidate efforts once a company is acquired. I give it, at most, 12-18 months before you start seeing major changes to both of those platforms that reflect Microsofts own interests.</p>",

Other supporters flatly rejected the free software movement&#x27;s ethical and social values. Whichever their views, when campaigning for open source, they neither cited nor advocated those values. The term “open source” quickly became associated with ideas and arguments based only on practical values, such as making or having powerful, reliable software. Most of the supporters of open source have come to it since then, and they make the same association.</p><p>&gt; The two terms describe almost the same category of software, but they stand for views based on fundamentally different values. Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement. For the free software movement, free software is an ethical imperative, essential respect for the users&#x27; freedom. By contrast, the philosophy of open source considers issues in terms of how to make software “better”—in a practical sense only. It says that nonfree software is an inferior solution to the practical problem at hand. Most discussion of “open source” pays no attention to right and wrong, only to popularity and success</p>',

At this point, it wouldn&#x27;t be greatly surprising if they record and save all voice calls.</p><p>There&#x27;s inertia in people and companies abandoning Skype because everybody knows it and everyone has it (or had it). But the thing that really preserves Skype is that it can connect from any device to device, including landlines, and it can do all of audio, video, and text.</p><p>A Skype-killer product needs (a) to run on all major platforms so you can communicate with someone regardless of whether they are on Windows, OS X, Linux, Android, or iOS, and (b) the ability to make connections to landline phones, (c) do all of audio, video, and text chat, (d) be reliable and trustworthy.

My group wanted mediawiki to run an internal wiki behind the firewall and it took 18 months to pass and my boss had about a dozen meetings and countless emails. There are cases where a developer had to write code in word because he couldn’t get a text editor (allegedly I didn’t actually witness it).  When your network is constantly under state sponsored attack these precautions aren’t pointless. But it takes a company like Microsoft or IBM to be able to work with security reviews and get them through quickly.</p>",

It&#x27;s been good to have a leader in open-source that is unaffiliated with anyone but the tech they chose to use (Ruby&#x2F;Rails). For me, it doesn&#x27;t matter who takes it over - it&#x27;s just sad to see a neutral player disappear.</p><p>With all that said, things have changed a lot over at GitHub over the past 2-3 years, so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m all that surprised that this was the outcome. Restructures, scandals, and some crazy comments over the few years has led me to believe that GitHub probably isn&#x27;t the same company that the development community embraced. For that reason, I can&#x27;t see Microsoft doing a &quot;Skype&quot; and merging GitHub into their platforms. Developers are fickle, and if Microsoft mess with GitHub then it&#x27;s not only a huge blow to the relations they&#x27;ve been trying to build for the past few years, it&#x27;s a guaranteed way to see developers flock to the next big service (i.e. GitLab).</p>",

MS today may still have some of its old habits but they do seem to have purged a lot of the &quot;not invented here&quot; problem that caused much embarrassment when the first attempts to migrate HotMail over to MS technologies failed. It also has pretty good integration with relevant MS tools (VS &amp; VS.code, etc.).</p><p>I expect to see them moving the base infrastructure over to Azure, but non-MS technologies are well enough supported on the platform so that won&#x27;t require any notable changes to the main codebase of the product itself (though perhaps some rework of the deployment processes to make them more optimal for their new target network?). These days they care a <i>lot</i> more about what runs on Azure than what is written using .Net and even what runs on Windows, and are comfortable releasing their own code using other tech (VS.code being based on Electron being the first example that springs to mind). They&#x27;d prefer you used an MS stack from top to bottom of course, but they are more than happy for projects to use other components in&#x2F;on Azure.</p><p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how they would position it alongside TFS, as there is a lot of overlap between the two products. My guess is they&#x27;d keep pushing TFS for people who are completely MS shops and GH for people with more varied stacks.</p>",

Or they may settle before it comes to that.</p><p>In 2015 Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe were caught trying to keep wages down by agreeing not to poach each others&#x27; employees. They paid $415 million to settle that case.</p><p>Please look up [Company Name] litigation on Wikipedia and you will find countless cases of large companies being convicted for something or settling this or that case.</p><p>Is any of this evil? That is a question everyone has to answer for themselves in each particular case, because &quot;evil&quot; is a moral term.

It&#x27;s difficult to get a widespread bad reputation in business, but once it&#x27;s obtained, it needs an incredible amount of repairing and good-doing to get rid of it again, and it&#x27;s not that Microsoft is doing any of it with their recent pseudo-openness approach, they just realized that OS lock-in doesn&#x27;t work any more and that they have to massively invest in cloud data&#x2F;services lock-in and the race for AI, by giving their OS&#x2F;VS away gratis, to prevent a world of Java and web developers and Apple after loosing the entire mobile sector. Looks like people will fall for that lock-in&#x2F;dependency again because they don&#x27;t understand digital, and Microsoft can buy their way out of their previously miserable situation. Wonder who paid for that, probably all the companies with Microsoft licenses because of lock-in and market dominance.</p>",

When I hit some library code I excpected to step into the library code, like in Java. Instead it force stepped over. Wouldn’t even let me see a decompile, like XCode shows you for code without available source. That’s microsoft for you. You get some binary libraries, docs that may or may not be crap, and Steve Balmer screaming “developers developers developers” while you bang your head trying to figure out some poorly documented library works. Microsoft relies on users’ ignorance, Stockholm syndrome, and the perception that Apple is more expensive. You get so much more from Apple, it’s incomparable.</p><p>That said this acquisition seems like a great fit and doesn’t trouble me at all. As much as I love it, GitHub is nothing special. Microsoft has little to ruin and a lot to improve. Seems like a solid vanity pickup for MSFT, and a good source of guiding vision for GH.</p>",

There is no danger anymore of depending too much on MS tech today. And there&#x27;s the tactical argument of &quot;the enemy of your enemy&quot; if you know what I mean; eg. these days it&#x27;s all about about your attention and invading your privacy (and MS also has no clean hands here). But still MS is mostly a software company with a predictable pattern, unlike darker forces able to influence public opinion to a degree not seen before, while MS shilling and astroturfing is easily spotted and amateurish by comparison.</p><p>The things I&#x27;m more concerned about when it comes to GitHub I&#x27;ve already posted in another story:</p><p>They could change the terms of service and essentially drive certain types of projects away. They could limit access to older builds and versions to non-paying customers. They could limit access to verified&#x2F;signed builds. They could reserve certain rights to your software such as they did with npmjs.com. They could run ads, offer IT staff skill matching and promotions, FizzBuzz-like services, or other LinkedIn integrations. They could come up with clever schemes for offering commercial licensing for open source. They could go after the enterprise package mirrors and policy checkers market Artifactory et al are serving. Not saying they&#x27;ll be doing that (MS isn&#x27;t stupid), but given MS is selling mainly to enterprises, there are many creative ways they could make money of it.</p><p>Overall, however, I&#x27;m not too worried. In fact, I think GitHub has become too much of a monopoly (though I have absolutely nothing against them at all), and I&#x27;m always for more choice.</p>",

This problem is not unique to Microsoft: other large companies have it too.

Frontline devs are expected to do as they are told, and are considered to be expendable &quot;resources&quot;. In contrast, at SV companies managers are more expendable than good engineers.</p>",

They are doing GREAT with Helm and are going in a different direction that looks super cool as they mothball Deis called Draft[3]. They are moving away from the OS company they used to be and betting heavily on cloud technologies and I think this Github purchase makes sense. Github has been stagnate for years. MS is embracing open source in a way they haven&#x27;t before, and I think they are doing so in a way that is going to surprise people.</p><p>In NO way am I a Microsoft fan boy. I&#x27;ve been windows free going on a decade. I run Linux Mint and OSX as my primary desktop environments. Apple is burning me hard, the way the computing world is going to change in the next couple years, cluster technology is going to be at it&#x27;s core and we are going to see some very different things grow out of it. I&#x27;m as shocked as anyone to see MS play nice with linux and especially contribute how they have to Kubernetes; which I think is the largest open source project in the world right now?</p><p>What if MS dumped resources into world class CI tools to go with Github? What if they made a Github open source module and would let you federate your content? I could see this being a really interesting thing. They could also screw us all, but under their current management I think they are getting ready to be competitive in an emergent environment that can&#x27;t exist without open source.</p><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deis.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deis.com</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.helm.sh&#x2F;using_helm&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.helm.sh&#x2F;using_helm&#x2F;</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;draft" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;draft</a></p>',

There are a ton of reasons people won&#x27;t take Gitlab seriously as a replacement right now.

Why give out Internet Explorer gratis, but not the OS if it&#x27;s that important for human communication?

It&#x27;s very useful information, but I do not recall an explicit prompt about Google collecting my location history in this way. Can advertisers target me based on this location history? I&#x27;m not sure. Does it affect how results are ordered on Maps? Probably. But I don&#x27;t know.</p><p>Relatedly, Maps shows me when a location is likely to be popular vs unpopular. I have to assume that&#x27;s based on the location history of everyone using Maps - seeing how long they spend in a place and at what time. But what percentage of Maps users are aware their information is being used in this way? I doubt the number is high.</p><p>Also, now I come to think of it, Google search itself. It shows different results sometimes when I&#x27;m logged in vs logged out, but it&#x27;s not clear why.

Assuming the consent basis, GDPR requires that consent needs to be for a given set of data and a defined processing model. You can’t process the same data in a different way without getting new consent, and you can’t collect data indiscriminately. So saying “additional functionality using the same data is fine” is true if and only if your original consent was wide enough to include that additional processing, but consent needs to be “granular” at the same time. Tbh it’s all a bit up in the air at the moment until some case law happens. Also obviously if you’re using a different basis then none of this applies.</p>",

My reasons:</p><p>1. It adds little to nothing to the discussion. You raise two items with no commentary but &quot;hmmmm&quot;, then offer a metaphor and an admitted conspiracy theory - neither of which you explain in depth nor draw interesting conclusions from.</p><p>2. There is inherent ridiculousness (almost to the point of trolling) in connecting a 20-year old report (1998) to a modern initiative, particularly considering the massive industry, technical, and organizational changes between those two events. Implying that one leads to another as part of a 30-year strategy to consume&#x2F;extinguish Linux assumes a level of long-term planning and, frankly, managerial competency that is almost unheard of in today&#x27;s public companies.</p><p>3. Assuming I can even understand your poorly constructed point, I still disagree with it (see #1 and #2) and, more importantly, think you fundamentally misunderstand the landscape in which Microsoft now competes. In a world increasingly accessed by mobile devices, MS has no mobile presence. In an OS landscape increasingly disintermediated by the browser, MS has little significant browser presence. They have oriented their entire organization around Azure (its biggest revenue growth area) and cross-platform applications deliverable in the browser and on 3rd party mobile OSes. They reorganized and, for the first time, no longer have a Windows division. Thinking they&#x27;re in the middle of some Machiavellian scheme to take back an increasingly irrelevant OS dominance position by extinguishing Linux (and failing because Linux is too big?) completely misses the point that Linux&#x27;s size wasn&#x27;t the cause of Microsoft&#x27;s inability to extinguish it, it was these other countervailing industry forces. And to imply that they&#x27;ve somehow failed also ignores the fact that MSFT&#x27;s market capitalization has had a nearly identical growth to GOOG and AAPL over the past two years while they&#x27;ve made this transition.</p><p>As they say on Food Network, for those reasons we had to chop you.</p>",

I care very deeply about Developer Experience and most of my open source work is related to dev-tooling.</p><p>Now that you know this about me, it&#x27;s easier for you understand why I am writing this post, and maybe why I think my opinion matters. Below is a copy-paste from the Twitter thread that I created on this topic:</p><p>1️⃣ @Microsoft is about to acquire @GitHub. A lot of folks are skeptical. But I have a different view. Many of you know I am building a course on VSCode.pro for that, I&#x27;ve seen firsthand, how 🆚@Code repo is one of the best #OpenSource repos out there</p><p>2️⃣— Once I created a GitHub issue at 🆚@Code repo for markdown and I was impressed by how vscodebot auto-assigned @MattBierner (who works on Markdown of VSCode) to the issue and then @tonybrix from MarkedJS helped me out. It was best GitHub automation WITH results ever!</p><p>3️⃣— Don&#x27;t &quot;@&quot; me coz I know about @Microsoft&#x27;s history with #OpenSource. I am a full-time open sourcerer and I can&#x27;t sit here quiet instead of supporting what looks like the new @Microsoft — @SatyaNadella&#x27;s moving the company from @Windows dependant to in-house @Linux dev</p><p>4️⃣— Every other day I find&#x2F;meet people working at @Microsoft using Linux&#x2F;Mac based devices — even bought by the company for them. Guess what? 1,000 MSFT Employees pushing open source code on GitHub. This is a BIG 🆕 change. Taking it lightly in 2018 would be tomfoolery.</p><p>5️⃣— I&#x27;ve been most inspired by teams behind 🆚@Code (@auchenberg ) and @Azure — I think that @JeffSand has built an incredible team of @AzureAdvocates folks like @ashleymcnamara @sarah_edo @jawache @burkeholland @simona_cotin @_clarkio @John_Papa @holtbt @film_girl @TommyLee</p><p>6️⃣—I&#x27;m a big fan of &quot;Dev Experience&quot; (DX) that&#x27;s why I pay $200 for a font I use in 🆚Code &amp; have built s of #OpenSource dev-tooling github.com&#x2F;ahmadawais—Teams at @Azure are doing a lot to make DX better for the cloud → @AzureFunctions + @Code integration is impressive!</p><p>7️⃣— GitHub&#x27;s been struggling to find a new CEO for a year. What if? \nIt&#x27;s my primary code hosting company. It&#x27;s helped me go full-time open source with the support from awesome dev community&#x2F;companies. Safe to say that @GitHub has made #OpenSource better</p><p>8️⃣— @Microsoft has done a lot for #OpenSource in the last 4 years with @SatyaNadella.</p><p>🆚 @Code&#x27;s love.\n @Linux Subsystem on @Windows.\n Draft.sh for @kubernetesio didn&#x27;t have a Windows version and still offers @MacHomebrew as the go-to way of installing it!</p><p>9️⃣—@GitHub is not exactly a cash-cow. @Microsoft has put money where their mouth is — out of 1.5 Million organizations on GitHub MSFT has most GitHub contributors to its repos, it&#x27;s the biggest company with over 1000 employees contributing code to GitHub →proof of good faith!</p><p>— I think @Microsoft is changing for good. The intent here&#x27;s to connect with developers and not offend them by disrupting a good company. MSFT won&#x27;t change a lot but this acquisition might make GitHub a lot better. Also, MSFT will jump into ROR. It&#x27;s high time for #OpenSource.</p><p>What are your thoughts on this whole thing?!\nPeace! ️</p>',

Now it just requires you to log in to even view someone&#x27;s name and function. It shows up in the search results alright, some day I should find a UA changer to spoof Google and see if they do IP checking or just UA header checking, but generally, they made it completely locked-in now, whereas it was semi-open (at least to view) before. It was a user-configurable setting whether your profile could be viewed by people who are not signed in, and now it&#x27;s just a completely walled garden.</p>",

It is _probably_ viable for a very powerful adversary (such as the NSA) to successfully trick someone working with binary blobs, like firmware for a black box. You can imagine a developer who (unusually) assiduously checks the firmware they&#x27;re provided to see that it works as intended, then uploads a new version to github, and the NSA trap is sprung, they substitute a modification with the same hash but different firmware that, perhaps, causes your billion dollar spy satellite to point its cameras at the sun, destroying it.</p><p>But if the developer is less assiduous this was all pointless, just send the &quot;burn spy sat&quot; firmware to the original developer and lie.</p><p>Or if the spy camera owners decide not to take this mysterious last-minute update, or they try it on their ground-based prototype first to check it works... bzzt, your hugely expensive SHA-1 trick was a waste of time.</p><p>Yes, SHA-1 is broken. Nobody should use it for anything new, and things that already use it should have been migrating already _before_ the official announcement from Google et al. But, Merkle-Damgard hashes have done this before, and will do it again, and so we know how this goes. You get a collision but don&#x27;t get anything else, critically you don&#x27;t get second-pre-image.</p><p>This means, the NSA doesn&#x27;t gain a way to substitute other stuff in a repo. They can only _collide_ their own things, by carefully choosing the inputs. So a plan where you just replace the _real_ firmware can&#x27;t work.</p><p>Also, the nature of this MD attacks smashes up the input state, which for git will usually be source code. A mysterious anonymous contributor is surprising enough, but when their proposed patch adds dozens of bytes of what seems to be binary noise, you know something is up. That&#x27;s why my example attack above involved firmware, where this might be less suspicious.</p><p>So yes, Git should have transitioned off SHA-1, and a window of opportunity for bad guys does exist, but it&#x27;s not the sort of gaping window you imagine.</p>",

Now it just requires you to log in to even view someone&#x27;s name and function. It shows up in the search results alright, some day I should find a UA changer to spoof Google and see if they do IP checking or just UA header checking, but generally, they made it completely locked-in now, whereas it was semi-open (at least to view) before. It was a user-configurable setting whether your profile could be viewed by people who are not signed in, and now it&#x27;s just a completely walled garden.</p>',

They’ve embraced open source a lot more than in the past and have clamped down a lot on the anti competitive practices they used for decades. I also have a good friend that works there and I’ve seen how the sausage is made from the inside a bit. They treat their employees really well and from what I’ve experienced they’re a good company to work for.</p><p>I don’t have a hard opinion on this acquisition for the OSS community, but it will be good for the employees and I’m hopeful that not much will change with Github as a service and somethings may even get better.

A pleasing respite from the world of team-developed commercial software.  It is difficult to imagine Github could remain the number distribution channel for individual authors of non-commercial code when it is run under the auspices of a large, proprietary enterprise and consumer software company.</p><p>Since its inception, I have been using simple tcp&#x2F;http clients and text-only browsers to download and browse source code from stable Github urls, as I did throughout the 90&#x27;s with Freshmeat, Sourceforge, etc.  To its credit, Github has always been very accessible.</p><p>What are the chances this kind of accessibilty will continue to be possible if Github is being administered by Microsoft.  \nDirect downloads of small, source code files, many with no licensing restrictions, no sign-ups, no web browser required, no hassle... Microsoft has never managed anything like that.  Microsoft has always done the opposite.  Indirect downloads of large collections of binaries, often coupled with installers, licensing restrictions, usually requiring some sign-up or click-through agreement, and today, possibly with telemetry.</p><p>I hope I am wrong to be concerned about this takeover.  Will Github continue to be the respository service of choice amongst authors of free source code?  Perhaps some will pull out and move their code elsewhere.</p>",

I hope this direction continues under new ownership.</p><p>GitLab on the other hand is focused on solving every facet of the development lifecycle within their core product. From their blog post about GitHub&#x27;s acquisition:</p><p>&gt; ... instead of integrating multiple tools together, we believe a single application, built from the ground up to support the entire DevOps lifecycle is a better experience leading to a faster cycle time.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how the different strategies play out.</p><p>P.S.

Seeing where they&#x27;re going with .NET core, VSCode and TypeScript makes me pretty confident they will be good stewards of the site.</p><p>Microsoft had their own open source hosting solution Codeplex but closed it and migrated all their stuff to GitHub so they could be where the community was. That was a bold move and I think demonstrates how they see the community now. This isn&#x27;t the Microsoft of the 90&#x27;s.</p><p>GitHub is great but it&#x27;s not profitable and I&#x27;m sure there are lots of improvements they could make with a bit of a cash injection.</p><p>On the flip side if Microsoft stuff it up or there is an exodus from Microsoft because people hate Microsoft, that&#x27;s not such a bad thing either.</p><p>There are great alternatives out there, it&#x27;s not the same landscape as when GitHub launched, everyone&#x27;s learnt from GitHub, GitHub&#x27;s biggest feature is the network effect. Everyone has an account and it&#x27;s super low friction to contribute there. If we can break that a bit and everyone has an account at 2 or 3 places I think we might see some great innovation as competitors try to differentiate themselves.</p><p>Finally on that point. Bitbucket is awesome, you can build apps that are integrated directly into the UI <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.atlassian.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;bitbucket&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.atlassian.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;bitbucket&#x2F;</a></p>',
